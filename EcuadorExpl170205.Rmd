  #Communities range in size from 28 to 872
  #Number of people in each community varies between years, usually at three different timepoints (though that varies as well)
  #Largest communities are: 
    #number 5 (between 717 and 872 individuals), 
    #followed by #4 with 445 to 553 individuals
  #Smallest communities are:
    #number 14 with 28-33 individuals
    #followed by 1 with 52-54 and 12 with 30-78
  #Potential Typical Communities
    #13: median number of people (122), but the number of people varies highly, and given the transitory nature this seems like subsequent analyses will be difficult

#Picking Villages:
  #Check that there is variation within village chosen so that there is signal that we can assess
  #Make sure there are enough children that its interesting
  #Check on if its 5 and under or just under 5
  #Check on the map
#Crosstabs and Logistics to see what the drivers of disease are since our prevalences are low
```


To save computational time:
-save as RData set
-run on citrix
-drill down on subsets to first understand the data
  -single village
  -highest 10% of illness
  
Early questions:
-differential rates of dihr. across:
  -time, village age, sex, other relevant covariates
-id people frequently sick and see if the villge is sicker the next week 
-visualizing patterns in illness over time

Later Questions:
-village incidence to lag predict other villages
-distances for spatial analyses
